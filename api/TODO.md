# Next Steps for Web RAG Search Implementation

## FastAPI Backend
1. Set up project environment
   - [ ] Install Python 3.8+ and required packages from requirements.txt
   - [ ] Install and start Ollama with the embedding model: `ollama run nomic-embed-text`
   - [ ] Create `.env` file with proper configuration
   - [ ] Create data directory for storing the index

2. Test API endpoints
   - [ ] Run the FastAPI server: `python main.py`
   - [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
   - [ ] Test indexing endpoint with sample data
   - [ ] Test search functionality
   - [ ] Test delete and clear endpoints

3. Potential improvements
   - [ ] Add authentication for the API
   - [ ] Implement batched embedding generation for better performance
   - [ ] Add support for different embedding models
   - [ ] Implement document-level metadata storage

## Browser Extension
1. Test the extension
   - [ ] Load the extension in Chrome
   - [ ] Test API connectivity indicator
   - [ ] Test indexing functionality
   - [ ] Test search functionality
   - [ ] Test management functionality (delete, clear)

2. Potential improvements
   - [ ] Add option to configure API URL from the extension UI
   - [ ] Implement caching of recent search results
   - [ ] Add visualization of index stats (embeddings per page, etc.)
   - [ ] Improve error handling and retry logic

## Deployment Considerations
1. Production deployment of FastAPI server
   - [ ] Use a production ASGI server (Uvicorn + Gunicorn)
   - [ ] Set up proper logging
   - [ ] Configure CORS for production
   - [ ] Set up monitoring
   
2. Extension packaging
   - [ ] Package the extension for Chrome Web Store
   - [ ] Create detailed documentation
   - [ ] Add version update mechanism
